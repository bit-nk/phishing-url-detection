### False Positive Secret Detection Notice

GitHub's automated security scanner flagged some dataset entries as potential **Telegram Bot Tokens**.
These were **false positives**, originating from phishing datasets that intentionally include URLs mimicking real tokens for research purposes (e.g., `https://api.telegram.org/bot<fake_token>`).

- No real or active credentials are present.
- All such entries have been reviewed and removed or sanitized.
- This dataset is used **strictly for cybersecurity and phishing detection research**, not for exploitation.

By documenting this, we maintain transparency and ethical compliance in data usage.
